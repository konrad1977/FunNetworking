## Installation

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/konrad1977/funnetworking", .branch("main")),
  ]
)
```

## Key features

FunNetworking is a lightweight wrapper around several monads found in [Funswift](https://github.com/konrad1977/funswift). It supports Chaining, Zipping, requests no matter if they are synchrounous or asynchrounous. 

- Zip and run multiple request at once and merge the result into one

- Zipping request can be mixed in with reading from disk or any other operation. It doesnt have to be a network request.

  - Async zip can be mixed with Sync operations and vice versa. 

- Chain operation using `>>-` operator or `flatMap`. 

- Built in retryability. All request function can be passed into a retry function that will wrap the function and run it x times

  - Retry support `debounce`:
    - Linear (every retry will pause n-seconds until next retry)
    - Exponential (every retry will double n-seonds for every retry)

  Retryability has no knowledge about networking at all, it works on the inner structur which can be Optional<T>, Result<T>, Deferred<Either>/Deferred<Result>, IO<Result>/IO<Either> and Reader<Result>. It can be called either by passing a function directly to retry or a curried version.

- mapT - support for some wrapped functors/monads

  - `Deferred` and `IO` has built in support for `mapT`, which means it can map on the wrapped functors data. 
    - Ex `IO<Result<Int, Error>>` can be `mapT(String.init)` which produces `IO<Result<String, Error>>`

- DecodeJsonData

  - Built in easy to use jsonDecoding. Supports curried version for injecting specialized JSONDecoder.

## Request types

FunNetworking supports both synchrounous and asynchronous requests with two different types of result wrapped inside the request type. Its backing types is either `IO` (synchrounous) or `Deferred` (Asynchrounous). 

| Asynchrounous requests | Description                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| requestAsyncR          | Deferred<Result<A, Error>> |
| requestAsyncE          | Deferred<Either<B, A>>     |

To get the result you need to `run` the deferred monad.

##### Example 1: Asynchronous request - requestAsyncR

```swift
import FunNetworking
import Funswift

func ageGuess(from name: String) -> Deferred<Result<AgeGuess, Error>> {
	"https://api.agify.io/?name=\(name)"
		|>	URL.init(string:)
		>=>	urlRequestWithTimeout(30)
		|>	requestAsyncR
		<&>	decodeJsonData
}

// Get value
ageGuess("Jane").run {Â result in 
	// handle result
}
```



| Synchrounous requests | Description          |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| requestSyncR          | IO<Result<A, Error>> |
| requestSyncE          | IO<Either<B, A>>     |

To get the result you need to call `unsafeRun()` which will be block the current thread until its done.

##### Example 2: Synchronous request - requestSyncR

```swift
func ageGuess(from name: String) -> IO<Result<AgeGuess, Error>> {
	"https://api.agify.io/?name=\(name)"
  	|>	URL.init(string:)
  	>=>	urlRequestWithTimeout(30)
  	|>	requestSyncR
  	<&>	decodeJsonData
}

let result: Result<AgeGuess, Error> = ageGuess().unsafeRun()
// Handle result
```

### How to do authorization?

FunNetworking support three ways of adding authorization (setting the authorization header)

-  Basic Auth - Simple username password. (base64encoded)
-  Bearer Auth. 
- Custom (Supports both custom data and header value fields). If this isn't good enough try using the `setHeader/setHeaders`

###### Example 3.1: Add basic authorization

```swift
func ageGuessWithBasicAuth(from name: String) -> IO<Result<Data, Error>> {
	"https://api.agify.io/?name=\(name)"
  	|>	URL.init(string:)
  	>=>	urlRequestWithTimeout(30)
  	|>	authorization(.basic(username: "guest", password: "guest"))
  	|>	requestSyncR
}
```

###### Example 3.2: Add OAuth authorization

```swift
func ageGuessWithOAuth(from name: String) -> IO<Result<Data, Error>> {
	"https://api.agify.io/?name=\(name)"
  	|>	URL.init(string:)
  	>=>	urlRequestWithTimeout(30)
  	|>	authorization(.bearer("place custom token here"))
  	|>	requestSyncR
}
```

### How to retry a request?

To do a retry all you need is to replace: `requestAsyncR` with (see line 8)

`retry(requestAsyncR, retries: 3, debounce: .linear(5))`

##### Example 4: Asynchronous request with retry - requestAsyncR

```swift
import FunNetworking
import Funswift

func ageGuess(from name: String) -> Deferred<Result<AgeGuess, Error>> {
	"https://api.agify.io/?name=\(name)"
  	|> 	URL.init(string:)
  	>=>	urlRequesstWithTimeout(30)
  	|>	retry(requestAsyncR, retries: 3, debounce: .linear(5))
  	<&>	decodeJsonData
}
```

| Debounce    |                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| linear      | Will wait n seconds until next retry    |
| exponential | Will multiply n seconds for every retry |



| Operators | Description                     |        Name |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ----------: |
| \|>       | Inject value into function      |        Pipe |
| >=>       | Compose that might fail         |        Fish |
| <&>       | Change value/type inside a type |         Map |
| >>-       | Flatmap in disquise             |        Bind |
| <*>       | Works like zip but with curry   | Applicative |
